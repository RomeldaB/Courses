Architecture:

expalin how an instruction work in a datapath
explain instruction analysis
hybrid compilation
difference compiler-interpreter

write a grammar *** - a set of rules
table given for expressions - recognize all words of this type
remove some transition rules and make it it a way that it recognizes sth (not the whole thing but ourselves)
MIPS - no C code to write mips, but from MIPS derive binary format (numbers given) just know the format and the lengths
datapath: mark relevant components, dont remember whole figure but draw the components for 1 or more instructions
delays: if give, path will be given, come up yourself which paths are relevant for some instruction which not
performance: determine slower quicker performances (copmute CPU execution time or similar)
No part 1 - No flip flops, no boolean, no midterm related topics
